In "El conejito soñador" by Eva María Rodríguez, we meet a dreamy rabbit living in a forest, surrounded by books and fantasy but lacking friends. His imaginative tales of chivalrous feats, underwater adventures, and space expeditions alienate his companions, leaving him isolated. Despite feeling dejected, the rabbit persists in crafting his stories, determined to keep writing.
