  cleaning_prompt: |
    I'm building a tool to clean and prepare documents for text-to-speech (TTS) processing. Please process the following PDF text with the following instructions:

    1. **Remove all non-essential elements**, including:
      - Headers, footers, and page numbers (even if repeated).
      - Website artifacts such as cookie banners, navigation menus, ads, comments, and any content that is not part of the main article or body text.
      - For PDFs with a **book layout** (two pages per physical page), split and clean both pages accordingly.

    2. **Preserve the main content only** — ensure the body text remains intact and fully readable.

    3. **Fix formatting issues**, including:
      - Removing unnecessary line breaks within sentences.
      - Correcting broken words split across lines.
      - Fixing OCR-related errors (e.g., misplaced characters, garbled words).

    4. **Maintain natural paragraph structure** to ensure smooth flow for TTS.

    5. **Do not include any commentary, explanations, or metadata** — return only the cleaned, plain text.
